# MIS_Input_validation
An innovative Python-based MIS testing framework that automates input validation and ensures data integrity with custom test cases and result reporting.

This repository contains a Python-based testing framework designed to automate the validation of input data for a Management Information System (MIS). The framework ensures data integrity and consistency through a series of automated test cases.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Validates dates, numerical values, and strings against predefined constraints.
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Organizes test inputs into valid and invalid partitions to ensure thorough testing.
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Includes test cases for the boundaries of input ranges to catch common off-by-one errors.
- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Dynamically generates test cases based on input space definitions.
- **Result Reporting**: Provides a detailed report of passed and failed test cases, including a summary of the test execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
